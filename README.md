#  Understanding Trends and Temporal Evolution of Covid-19 Literature


This study aims to help policy-makers by providing useful insights about the domain areas most impacted during the Covid-19 pandemic. Some of the most
discussed domain during pandemic include Education, Mental health, Healthcare, children, technology, lockdown

#
methodology

##
1. Binary Classification

The Binary Classification is divided into following steps: 
  ######1. Data Collection
  ######2. Data Filteration
  ######3. Text Preprocessing
  ######4. Separation of Covid-19 literature using LSTM
  ######5. Separation of Covid-19 literature using Machine Learning Classifiers
        
               /**** M Classifiers include SVM, Logistic Regression, Ada Boost, 
                XG Boost, KNN, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest   ****/
 
##2. Multiclass Classification

Multiclass classification is applied on covid-separated papers. LDA Topic modelling assigns a topic to each paper based on the domain that fits best

Multicalss Classification steps:
  ######1. Exploratory text analysis of covid-sepated literature
  ######2. Data Preparation using Natural Language Processing
                  
         /***Tokenization, dictionary, Bag-of-words (BOW) corpus ****/
         
 ######3. Latent Dirchlet Allcation (LDA) Topic Modelling
 
##3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Exploring and visualaztion of trends
  ######1.Covid-19 Trends
  ######2.Vaccine trends

##4. Results and Discussion 
  ######1.Evaluating Binary Classifier Performance Evaluation
                 /*** LSTM Performance, ML Classifiers Performance ***/
  ######2.Multiclassification Performance Evaluation
                 /***LDA Performance Evaluation***/
